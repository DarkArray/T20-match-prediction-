# T20-match-prediction-
Using Data Set of previously conducted matches to try and  predict the outcome of an upcoming match(probability not certainity)  
In this prediction we are using three cases of a match to give separate results and after that combining those results to give last prediction .
case 1# predicting the winner on the basis of toss . If a team wins the toss then how whether or not they win the match based on previously conducted matches .
case 2# predicting the winner on the basis of home team advantage . If a particular team is playing a match on its home ground then how many times it wins based on the data set of previously conducted matches .
case 3# predicting the winner based on the previous encounters of both teams. Giving dummy values to the teams and then predicting winner on the basis of their encounters in previously encountered matches .

After combining all these results we then predict the actual outcome with the predicted out come .
